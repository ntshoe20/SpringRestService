# SpringRestService 2018-07-21
This project was used to test spring rest web service. The readme.txt file will contain how to start up and the url to the example
I've included the exmaple I followed which was easy for me to understand but you still need more resources.

Step 1 - Create a maven project
Step 2 - add the dependencies in the POM.xml
Step 3 - Build the project (I always build when I'm using eclispe, this is done before I start coding)
